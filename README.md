# Notes
The idea of this page it's to serve as a digital resume, through this platform I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of my abilities and past work.
Since I'm a student it's important to develop these ideas and practice what I'm learning.
This portfolio page is inspired from <a href="https://github.com/bchiang7">Brittany's</a>.
<br>Because this is not a 100% original work, although I didn't copy anything I simply saw a thing and decided to do it myself ðŸ¤“, this project probably will change over time. So expect changes in the future.

## Installation

If (for any reason) you want to edit this project and use locally you can, as always I'm using ```express``` , so you'll need ```node``` and ```npm```.

Clone this repo, then in your terminal (make sure you are in the project folder):
```
npm install
```
Make sure to check what PORT is being used in the ```app.mjs``` file. <br>Then run the start script:
```
npm start
```
