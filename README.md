# Notes
The idea of this page it's to serve as a <a href="https://joaobraun.netlify.app">digital resume</a>, through this platform I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of my abilities and past work.
Since I'm a student it's important to develop these ideas and practice what I'm learning.
This portfolio page layout is inspired from <a href="https://github.com/bchiang7">Brittany's</a>.
